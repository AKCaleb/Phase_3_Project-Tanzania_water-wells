# Scoping non-functional water pumps in Tanzania.
## Business Understanding
No civilization can survive without water. The World Bank is focused on ensuring our civilization and ecosystems do not lack water. In Tanzania, a developing nation, adequate water can solve a lot of problems including including improved sanitation and quality of life generally. Maji Marefu is an NGO tasked with scoping non-functional pumps so that they can be replaced. By identifying and replacing these non-functional pumps, Maji Marefu aims to improve access to clean water and contribute to the well-being of communities across the country.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement revolves around developing a predictive model to accurately predict non-functional water pumps in Tanzania. This predictive model will play a crucial role in budget allocation and resource planning for organizations involved in water infrastructure management, such as Maji Marefu.

To address this problem, we plan to employ three different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each algorithm will be trained on historical data of water pump features, including location, operational status, and other relevant attributes, to predict the likelihood of a water pump being non-functional.

## Success Metrics
The successful development of these predictive models will enable Maji Marefu to prioritize maintenance and repair efforts effectively, ensuring the efficient allocation of resources and the continued provision of clean water to communities in Tanzania.
